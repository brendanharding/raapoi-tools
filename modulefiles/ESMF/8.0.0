module-whatis "Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) is a suite of software
tools for developing high-performance, multi-component Earth science modeling
applications. Such applications may include a few or dozens of components
representing atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, or other physical domains, and
their constituent processes (dynamical, chemical, biological, etc.). Often
these components are developed by different groups independently, and must
be coupled together using software that transfers and transforms data among
the components in order to form functional simulations."
